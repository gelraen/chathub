chathub is multiprotocol chatroom hub. It should allow users from different
groupchats, possibly with different protocols, to communicate with each other
transparently.

Sample configuration:
{hub, hub1, [],
        [{irc, {"localhost", 6667, "#chat", [
                        {nick, "chathub"},
                        {realname, "Multiprotocol chatroom hub"},
                        {username, "chathub"}
                ]
                }},
        {dc, {"localhost", 411, [
                        {nick, "chathub"},
                        {sharesize, 0},
                        {description, "Multiprotocol chatroom hub"}
                ]}}
        ]
}.

This config defines one hub, which connects users from IRC channel #chat and
NMDC hub.
